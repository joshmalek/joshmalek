### About Me ðŸ“–
I am a Computer Science major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I will be graduating in the Spring of 2021 with a concentration in AI & Data, and a minor in Psychology. I am a member of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, and passionate in spreading the love of technology in younger generations. I am currently looking to start my career after I graduate, with a Masters planned in the future. I love learning, and I want to continue after I complete my studies at RPI. In my free time, I love gaming (personal favorites include Overwatch and CS:GO), and I am a member of RPI's competing collegiate Overwatch team.

### The Future ðŸ”®
For my professional career, I love working with new and exciting technologies, and developing for the future. I am currently looking for employment to start after I graduate, so feel free to contact me! I am excited for what the future holds, and hope I can play a part in creating it.
